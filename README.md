####################
This Android application was designed to meet the following requirements:

This final project must incorporate the following concepts we have learned throughout the course: 

+ Receiving user input 
+ Navigation between two or more fragments or activities (using a NavGraph)
+ LiveData objects and observers 
+ Use of a ViewModel (or Shared ViewModel) to store data and functions  

Additionally, you must include one or more of the following: 

+ Using network connectivity and coroutines to get data from the internet
+ Using the Room library to store data on a user's device 

Additionally, if your application involves the display of lists of data, you will be expected to use a RecyclerView to do so.
